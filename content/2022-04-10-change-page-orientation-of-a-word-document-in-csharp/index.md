summary: 'Every page of the document may contain different layouts. It depends on the content of the page; that which orientation suits it. As a developer, we can change the orientation of each page to the one it suits. In this article, we will learn to **change the orientation of a page in a Word document using C#**. Separately, we will see how to change the portrait layout to landscape and then how to change the landscape orientation to portrait with the .NET applications.'

Every page of the document may contain different layouts. It depends on the content of the page; that which orientation suits it. As a developer, we can change the orientation of each page to the one it suits. In this article, we will learn to **change the orientation of a page in a Word document using C#**. Separately, we will see how to change the portrait layout to landscape and then how to change the landscape orientation to portrait with the .NET applications.

## .NET API for Changing Word Page Orientation
**GroupDocs.Merger** showcases the .NET API that enables changing the orientation of Word document pages. Additionally, the API allows moving pages, removing pages, splitting of documents, extraction, and rotation of document pages within the .NET applications. We will use this [GroupDocs.Merger for .NET][1] to change the page orientation of DOC/DOCX files using C#. For the details and other features of the API, you can visit the [documentation][2].

You can download the **DLLs** or **MSI** installer from the [downloads section][3] or install the API in your .NET application via [NuGet][4].

```
PM> Install-Package GroupDocs.Merger
```

## Change Orientation of a Word Page to Landscape using C#

Letâ€™s begin with a simple way how to programmatically make a page landscape in a Word document. The following steps allow changing the page orientation of a Word document to landscape using C#:

- Load the Word document using [Merger][5].
- Prepare the [orientation options][6] and set the [mode][7] to landscape.
- Change the orientation using [ChangeOrientation()][8].
- Save the updated document using the appropriate [Save()][9].

The following C# code changes the portrait orientation of some pages of a Word document to the landscape.

## Conclusion
To conclude, we learned how to change the page orientation of Word documents using C# within .NET applications. We saw the source code example that changed the portrait orientation of the selected pages of a DOCX file to the landscape. Similarly, we changed the landscape orientation of the selected pages to portrait using the C# example. You can try building your own application that can toggle the orientation Word pages online.
