We can easily merge two or more Word documents into a single document using C#. We do it because sharing or printing a single file is easier than processing multiple files. In this article, we will learn&nbsp;**how to merge Word documents using C#**.

The following topics shall be covered in this article:

  * [C# API to Merge Word Documents][2]
  * [Merge Two or More Word Documents using C#][3]
  * [Combine Specific Pages of Word Documents using C#][4]
  * [Merge DOCX Files and Secure with Password using C#][5]
  * [Merge Word Document into PDF using C#][6]

## C# API to Merge Word Documents {#CSharp-API-to-Merge-Word-Documents}

For merging [DOC][7] or [DOCX][8]&nbsp;files, we will be using [GroupDocs.Merger for .NET][9] API. Please either [download][10]&nbsp;the DLL of the API or install it using&nbsp;[NuGet][11].

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>Install-Package GroupDocs.Merger</code></pre>

## Merge Two or More Word Documents using C# {#Merge-Two-or-More-Word-Documents-using-CSharp}

We can easily merge two or more Word documents programmatically by following the steps given below:

  * Firstly, load the DOCX file using the&nbsp;**_[Merger][12]_**&nbsp;class.
  * Next, call the&nbsp;**_[Merger.Join()][13]_**&nbsp;method with target DOCX file path to merge with the loaded file.
  * Then, repeat the above step to merge more files.
  * Finally, call the&nbsp;**_[Merger.Save()][14]_**&nbsp;method with the output file path to save the merged file.

The following code sample shows how to merge two or more DOCX files using C#.

## Combine Specific Pages of Word Documents using C# {#Combine-Specific-Pages-of-Word-Documents-using-CSharp}

We can combine specific pages of Word documents programmatically by following the simple steps mentioned below:

  * Firstly, load the DOCX file using the&nbsp;**_[Merger][12]_**&nbsp;class.
  * Next, create an instance of the&nbsp;**_[JoinOptions][16]_&nbsp;**class with the start page and end page number. You may also set range mode to join odd or even pages from the specified page range. 
  * Then, call the _**[Merger.Join()][13]**_ method with the target DOCX file path and _JoinOptions_ object as arguments. The _JoinOptions_ object merges specific pages of the target file with the source file.
  * Finally, call the&nbsp;**_[Merger.Save()][14]_**&nbsp;method with the output file path to save the merged file.

The following code sample shows how to combine selected pages of Word documents using C#.

## Merge DOCX Files and Secure with Password using C# {#Merge-and-Secure-with-Password-using-CSharp}

We can merge two or more DOCX files and then secure the merged file with a password programmatically by following the simple steps given below:

  * Firstly, load the DOCX file using the&nbsp;**_[Merger][12]_**&nbsp;class.
  * Next, call the&nbsp;**_[Merger.Join()][13]_**&nbsp;method with target DOCX file path to merge with the loaded file.
  * Optionally, repeat the above step to merge more files.
  * Then, set password using&nbsp;**_[AddPasswordOptions][17]_**
  * After that, call the&nbsp;**_[Merger.AddPassword()][18]_**&nbsp;method with&nbsp;_AddPasswordOptions_.
  * Finally, call the&nbsp;**_[Merger.Save()][14]_**&nbsp;method to save the password-protected merged file.

The following code sample shows how to merge multiple Word documents and then **secure the merged file with a password using C#**.

## Merge Word Documents into PDF using C# {#Merge-Word-Document-into-PDF-using-CSharp}

We can merge Word documents into a PDF document programmatically by following the simple steps given below:

  * Firstly, load the PDF file using the&nbsp;**_[Merger][12]_**&nbsp;class.
  * Next, call the&nbsp;**_[Merger.Join()][13]_**&nbsp;method with target DOCX file path to merge with the loaded file.
  * Optionally, repeat the above step to merge more files.
  * Finally, call the&nbsp;**_[Merger.Save()][14]_**&nbsp;method with the output PDF file path to save the merged file.

The following code sample shows **how to merge DOCX files into a PDF file using C#**.
